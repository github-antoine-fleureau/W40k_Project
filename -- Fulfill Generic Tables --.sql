VALUES
    ('Acute Senses', 'If a unit contains at least one model with this special rule, and that unit arrives on a random table edge (due to Outflank, or other special rules), then you can choose which table edge they arrive from.'),
    ('Adamantium Will', 'A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule receives a +1 bonus to Deny the Witch tests.'),
    ('And They Shall Know No Fear', 'A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule automatically passes Fear and Regroup tests. When it Regroups, the unit does not make the 3" Regroup move, but can instead move, shoot (or run) and declare charges normally in that turn. Furthermore, if a unit containing one or more models with this special rule is caught by a Sweeping Advance, they are not destroyed, but remain locked in combat instead.'),
    ('Anti', 'This rule is always presented as Anti-X where X identifies a specific type of unit. A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule re-rolls failed To Hit and To Wound rolls if attacking the Anti-Type ennemy. This applies both to shooting and close combat attacks.'),
    ('Armourbane', 'If a model has this special rule or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armor penetration in close combat. Moreover, if a model has this special rule, or is attacking with a Melee weapon that has this special rule, it rolls an additional D6 for armor penetration in close combat.'),
    ('Assault', 'If a unit that Advanced this turn contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s Shooting phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with. A model carrying an Assault weapon can still charge into close combat in the Assault phase.'),
    ('Assault Vehicle', 'Passengers disembarking from Access Points on a vehicle with this special rule can charge on the turn they do so (even in a turn that the vehicle was destroyed, or in the following turn) unless the vehicle arrived from Reserve that turn.'),
    ('Barrage', 'All Barrage weapons use blast markers and consequently use the rules for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions:
    Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their minimum range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the Ballistic Skill of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit! is rolled on the scatter dice, the blast marker always scatters a full 2D6. If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its minimum range.
    To determine whether a unit wounded by a Barrage weapon is allowed a cover save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the blast marker, instead of from the firing model. Hits against vehicles are always resolved against their side armor.
    Multiple Barrages: If a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:
    The Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier.
    Once the first marker is placed, roll a scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed.
    If a Hit! is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker). Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of hits and roll To Wound for these hits. To determine Wound allocation and cover saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.
    Apocalyptic Barrage: An Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped apocalyptic barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it.
    Once the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the apocalyptic barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Wound allocation and cover saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire apocalyptic barrage marker.'),
    ('Bladestorm', 'When firing a weapon with this special rule, a To Wound roll of 6 wounds automatically, regardless of the target’s Toughness, and is resolved at AP 4'),
    ('Blast', 'To use a Blast weapon, place the blast marker over the target models base or hull within range. Roll D3 for scatter and add the firers Weapon Skill. Hits are resolved normally, allocated to models under the marker, and wounds go to the closest model in t he target unit, regardless of line of sight.
    Multiple Blasts: If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described above and determine how many hits are scored with each individual blast marker. After the last shot, add up the total number of hits scored and roll all the To Wound rolls as normal.
    Blast Weapons and Re-rolls: If a model can re roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a Blast weapon, the player must re roll both the scatter dice and the D 3
    Blast Weapons and Snap Shots: Blast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.
    Large Blast: Large Blast weapons use the 5 " blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.
    Massive Blast: Massive Blast weapons use the 7 " blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.
    Apocalyptic Blast: Apocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10 " blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.
    Apocalyptic Mega Blast (5" 5"/7 "/10 Apocalyptic Mega blast weapons use the apocalyptic blast marker. They obey the rules for Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:
    Apocalyptic Mega Blast weapons feature three Strength and AP values, each corresponding to a specific zone on the blast marker. Hits depend on the zone where the target model is located. If a model overlaps zones, use the best values. Hits for each zone ar e calculated separately. When considering cover saves or allocating wounds, assume the shot originates from the center of the blast marker, not the firing model. Hits against vehicles are resolved against their side armor.'),
    ('Blind', 'Units hit by models or weapons with this rule must take an Initiative test at the phases end. If passed, no effect; if failed, the units Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill become 1 until their next turn. Attacking units automatically pass this test. Models lacking Initiative are unaffected.'),
    ('Bombs', 'Bombs are weapon types unique to Flyers and Flyer Monsters. All Bombs have the One Use Only special rule. Unlike other weapons, Bombs must be used in the Movement phase of their turn, in a special kind of attack called a Bombing Run. A model ca n only drop one Bomb in its Movement phase. If a model drops a Bomb, it counts as having already fired one weapon in its ensuing Shooting phase and may not move Flat Out.'),

    ('Crusader', 'A unit with this rule rolls an extra die for Run moves and picks the highest result. It also adds D3 to its Sweeping Advance totals (roll each time).'),
    ('Daemon', 'Models with the Daemon special rule have a 5++ invulnerable save and have the Fear special rule.'),
    ('Deep Strike', 'To Deep Strike, units must have the Deep Strike special rule and start in Reserve, clearly specified to the opponent. Some units must always Deep Strike. During Deep Strike, place one model and scatter. Other models form circles around it. They treat difficult terrain as dangerous.

Units arriving in ruins start on the ground floor; in non--ruined buildings, they start on top or treat it as impassable.

    Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects: Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the character leaves the unit, both he and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the character accordingly. Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after himself having been the target of an ongoing effect) benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.'),
