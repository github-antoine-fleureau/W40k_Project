    Battle-shocked units have an OC of 0 and their controlling player cannot use Stratagems to affect them.
    Battle-shocked units must take Desperate Escape tests if they Fall Back.
    Progress to the Movement phase.'),
    ('Movement Phase', 'Select a unit in your army to move.
    When a unit moves it can either make a Normal Move, Advance or Remain Stationary. Units that are within Engagement Range of any enemy models can only either Fall Back or Remain Stationary.
    Normal Move: Models move up to M". Cannot move within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
    Advance: Models move up to M+D6". Cannot move within Engagement Range of enemy models. Units that Advance cannot shoot or charge this turn.
    Remain Stationary: Models cannot move this phase.
    Fall Back Move: Models move up to M". Units that Fall Back cannot shoot or declare a charge in the same turn. Models can move over enemy models when Falling Back, but you must take Desperate Escape tests for them before they do so (excluding models that can Fly).
    If a Battle-shocked unit is selected to Fall Back, take a Desperate Escape test for every model in that unit. Desperate Escape Test: Roll one D6. On a 1-2, one model from that unit is destroyed.
    Moving Into Difficult Terrain: If a unit starts its move outside difficult terrain, the player must declare if he wants his unit to try to enter difficult terrain as part of their move. If he chooses not to, the unit moves as normal but may not enter difficult terrain. If he chooses for a unit to do so, the unit must take a Difficult Terrain test.
    To take a Difficult Terrain test, roll 2D6 and select the highest result, this is the maximum distance, in inches, that any of the models in the unit may move. Even if the distance rolled is too short for any of the models to reach the difficult terrain, the unit is still slowed down as described above. We assume that their approach is cautious as they attempt to ascertain whether any enemies are within. You should also note that, if you take the Difficult Terrain test, you are not compelled to move the models, as you might not have rolled high enough to make it worth moving at all.
    Moving Within Difficult Terrain: If any models in a unit start their move in difficult terrain, they are affected by the terrain and must take a Difficult Terrain test. No models in the unit can move more than the distance indicated by the test, even if they are not in difficult terrain.
    Dangerous terrain follows all the rules for difficult terrain In addition, each model must take a Dangerous Terrain test as soon as it enters, leaves or moves within dangerous terrain.
    To take a Dangerous Terrain test, roll a D6. On a result of a 1, that model suffers a Wound. The model may take an armour or invulnerable save, but not a cover save, against this Wound.
    Once a model has taken a Dangerous Terrain test for a particular scenery model, it does not test for that terrain again in the same phase. However, if the model moves into a different area of dangerous terrain, this must be tested for as normal.
    Models can move freely over terrain features 2" or less in height. Models cannot move through terrain features taller than 2", but can climb up and down them.
    Fly models can move over enemy models when they make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move. Fly models that start or end a move on a terrain feature measure distance moved through the air when they make a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move.
    A unit can embark within a friendly Transport if all of its models end a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within 3" of that Transport. A unit cannot embark and disembark in the same phase.
    Units that start your Movement phase embarked within a Transport can disembark this phase, provided their Transport has not Advanced or Fallen Back. If a unit disembarks before its Transport moves, it can act normally. If a unit disembarks after its Transport moves, it cannot move or charge this turn, but can otherwise act normally. Disembarking units must be set up wholly within 3" of their Transport and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models (or the unit cannot disembark). Units that disembark this turn cannot Remain Stationary.
    If a Transport is destroyed, any embarked units must disembark. Roll one D6 for each model that disembarks: for each 1, that model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound. Until the start of its controlling player’s next Command phase, the disembarking unit is Battle-shocked. Until the end of the turn, the disembarking unit counts as having made a Normal move, and cannot declare a charge.
    Units disembarking a destroyed Transport that cannot be set up wholly within 3" of it must perform an Emergency Disembarkation: Must be set up wholly within 6" of it instead of wholly within 3". Suffer 1 mortal wound for each roll of 1-3, instead of each roll of 1. Any disembarking model that cannot be set up is destroyed.
    Select another unit in your army to move.
    Once all your units have moved, progress to the Reinforcements step.
    Reinforcement unit: Unit that starts the battle in a location other than the battlefield. Set up your Reinforcement units, one at a time, as described by the rules that let them start the battle in locations other than the battlefield. Reinforcement units cannot make a Normal Move, an Advance, Fall Back or Remain Stationary this turn. Reinforcement units always count as having moved this turn. Any Reinforcement unit not set up on the battlefield by the end of the battle counts as destroyed.
    Once all your Reinforcement units have been set up, progress to the Psychic phase.'),
    ('Psychic Phase', 'Select a Psyker in your army to manifest its psychic powers.
    All Psykers know Smite. Psykers will know additional psychic powers, as described on their datasheets. Select psychic power. Attempt to manifest the psychic power by taking a Psychic test.The opponent can attempt to deny the psychic power by taking a Deny the Witch test. If successfully manifested, resolve the psychic power’s effects. Select another psychic power.
    Psychic test: Passed if 2D6 equals or exceeds psychic power’s warp charge. If double 1 or double 6 rolled, Psyker suffers Perils of the Warp.
    Deny the Witch: Passed if 2D6 exceeds result of the opposing Psyker’s Psychic test. Only one attempt can be made to deny each psychic power.
    The target unit contains one or more models with:	                            Modifier
    The Psyker, Psychic Pilot or Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule	        +1
    A Mastery Level higher than the Psyker manifesting the power	                    +1
    The Adamantium Will special rule	                                                +1
    Perils of the Warp: When a Psyker suffers Perils of the Warp, it indicates that something horrible has happened to the Psyker, the forces of the Daemon-haunted Warp clawing at the Psyker’s mind, threatening to engulf and destroy him. If a unit suffers Perils of the Warp, roll a D6 and consult the Perils of the Warp table below. If the unit has the Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule, the effects of the Perils of the Warp result apply a randomly determined model in the unit who has the Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule. Note that suffering Perils of the Warp does not necessarily mean that a psychic power fails to manifest. Assuming that the Psychic test was successful and any Deny the Witch test failed, the psychic power still manifests, regardless of whether or not the Psyker in question suffers a Wound or is slain by Perils of the Warp.
    D6	Result
    1	Dragged into the Warp: The Psyker must take a Leadership test. If the test is passed, the Psyker suffers 1 Mortal Wound. If the test is failed, the Psyker is removed as a casualty and his unit suffers D6 Strength 6 AP1 hits. For Wound allocation purposes, assume the attack is coming from the Psyker that suffered Perils of the Warp.
    2	Mental Purge: The Psyker suffers 1 Mortal Wound. In addition, the psychic power attempted to manifest by the Psyker is immediately lost, and cannot be used by the Psyker for the rest of the battle.
    3	Power Drain: The Psyker suffers 1 Mortal Wound. In addition, if it is currently the Psychic phase, all new psychic test passed are worsed by 1.
    4	Psychic Backlash: The Psyker suffers 1 Mortal Wound. 
    5	Empyric Feedback: The Psyker must take a Leadership test. If the test is failed, the Psyker suffers 1 Mortal Wound.
    6	Warp Surge: The Psyker must take a Leadership test. If the test is failed, the Psyker suffers 1 Mortal Wound. If the test is passed, the Psyker gains a 3+ Invulnerable save as well as the Fleshbane, Armourbane and Smash special rules, until the start of the next friendly Psychic phase.
    Psychic Hoods: Each time a unit (or model) is targeted by an enemy psychic power and is within 12" of a friendly model with a psychic hood, the wearer of the hood can attempt to Deny the Witch in their stead, as if he were in the target unit. If the Deny the Witch attempt is failed, the psychic power is resolved as normal, but effects only the initial target, not the wearer of the hood.
    If a model with a psychic hood is embarked in a vehicle or building, he can only use the hood to nullify powers targeting the vehicle or building he is embarked within.
    Types of Psychic Powers:
    Blessing: Blessings grant extra abilities to the Psyker’s allies, such as characteristic boosts or additional special rules. Blessings target one or more friendly units and, unless otherwise stated, last until the start of the Psyker’s next Psychic phase.
    Blessings can affect units that are locked in close combat and can affect the Psyker himself. The benefit of any one particular blessing can only be gained once per unit per turn, but benefits from different blessings are cumulative. Unless otherwise stated, blessings cannot modify characteristics above 10 or below 1 (or below 2, in the case of Leadership).
    Conjuration: Conjuration powers can summon units across great distances, call new allies to the fray, or even create them from the raw stuff of the Warp. Each conjuration power specifies the type and number of models to be conjured. Unless stated otherwise, the new unit cannot take any additional options or upgrades. If you do not have enough models to place the entire unit on the board, place as many as you can, the excess are destroyed.
    When the power is resolved, the new unit then arrives via Deep Strike, within the power’s maximum range; the new unit is under your control and is treated as having arrived from Reserves for all rules purposes. If the new unit suffers a Deep Strike mishap and ends up in Ongoing Reserves, it can Deep Strike anywhere on the board when it enters play.
    If the new unit is a Psyker, generate its psychic power(s) as soon as the conjuration is manifested; the new unit cannot attempt to manifest conjuration powers on the same turn it was itself conjured. If the new unit has any random powers/abilities that would normally need to be generated before the start of the game, generate them at the same time. Unless otherwise noted, conjured units are scoring units.
    Conjuring Daemons: If a conjuration power creates a unit from Codex: Chaos Daemons and that unit’s Army List Entry includes the option to take an Icon of Chaos, an Instrument of Chaos and/or the option to upgrade one model to a character, you may take any of these options for free provided you have the appropriate model available. Unless stated otherwise, the unit cannot take any further upgrades or options.
    Malediction: Maledictions weaken the Psyker’s enemies by reducing their characteristics or inflicting special rules that penalise their abilities. Maledictions target one or more enemy units and, unless otherwise stated, last until the start of the Psyker’s next Psychic phase. Maledictions can affect units that are locked in close combat. Note that bonuses and penalties from different maledictions are always cumulative, but cannot, unless otherwise stated, take characteristics above 10 or below 1 (or below 2, in the case of Leadership).
    Witchfire: Witchfire powers are shooting attacks. Indeed, they are often referred to as psychic shooting attacks, and many have profiles similar to ranged weapons. Just like when shooting a weapon, a Psyker must be able to see the target unit (or target point) and cannot be locked in combat if he wishes to manifest a witchfire power. Similarly, a witchfire power must roll To Hit, unless it is has the Blast special rule, in which case it scatters as described in the Blast special rule, or it is a Template weapon, which hit automatically. Psykers can make Snap Shots in the Psychic phase with witchfire powers in the same way as with other shooting weapons. Saves can be taken against Wounds from witchfire in the same way as for any other shooting attack, and hits are allocated to the closest target models to the Psyker.
    Unlike firing a shooting weapon though, a Psyker can manifest several different witchfire powers during the same phase (assuming he has enough Warp Charge) and each can target a different unit if you so choose. Manifesting witchfire powers does not prevent the Psyker (or his unit) from firing weapons in the following Shooting phase, nor does it prevent the Psyker’s unit from Running, Turbo-boosting or moving Flat Out. A Psyker who manifests a witchfire power can target a different unit with his other ranged weapons in the Shooting phase. Witchfire powers cannot be used to make Overwatch attacks.
    There are several different sub-types of witchfire, each applying slightly different targeting restrictions. If the witchfire does not list a sub-type, or simply describes itself as a psychic shooting attack, use the rules given above to resolve it. If it has one of the following subtypes, use the rules for that sub-type.
    Beam: To use a witchfire power with the beam sub-type, target a point within the power’s range and trace a line (about 1mm thick) between the chosen point and the centre of the Psyker’s base, this line cannot be drawn over any unit that is locked in combat. All units under the line (friend and foe) are hit, with the exception of Zooming Flyers, Swooping Flying Monsters and the Psyker himself. Each unit hit by the attack takes a number of hits equal to the number of models from that unit that are under the line. Only one unit that has a model under the line can attempt to Deny the Witch.
    Focussed Witchfire: Some witchfire powers can pick out models in an enemy unit, these are called focussed witchfire powers. They follow all the normal rules for witchfire, but you can choose the specific model in the target unit that you want the power to affect. When the Psychic test is taken for focussed witchfire, pay close attention to the number of Warp Charge points harnessed. If the total number of Warp Charge points harnessed exceeds the Warp Charge cost required to manifest the psychic power, the power is resolved against the model you chose. If the cost to manifest the power is met, but not exceeded, resolve the power against the closest model in the target unit instead.
    Nova: A nova power automatically targets and hits all enemy units within the psychic power’s maximum range, regardless of line of sight, being locked in combat, intervening models/terrain and so on. Otherwise, a nova is treated like a shooting attack, and indeed will have a profile like a ranged weapon. Only one unit that is within the power’s maximum range can attempt to Deny the Witch.
    Select another Psyker in your army to manifest its psychic powers.
    Once all your Psykers have manifested psychic powers, progress to the Shooting phase.'),
    ('Shooting Phase', 'Before a unit shoots, select the targets for all of its ranged weapons.
    Each model of the firing unit can only shoot on models that are in his own lin of sight and within range of the weapon being used.
    Models with more than one ranged weapon can shoot them at the same or different targets, but models cannot split attacks from the same weapon across more than one target.
    Models in the same unit can shoot at the same or different targets.
    When a unit shoots, select targets then resolve attacks with any or all ranged weapons that models in that unit are equipped with.
    If a unit targets multiple units, all attacks against one unit must be resolved before resolving attacks against the next.
    Units cannot shoot while they are within Engagement Range of any enemy units. Units cannot shoot at targets within Engagement Range of any friendly units.
    MONSTErs and VEHICLES can shoot, and be shot at, even while they are within Engagement Range of enemy units. Each time a ranged attack is made by or against such a unit, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll (unless shooting with a Pistol).
    MONSTErs and VEHICLES can target other units, but cannot resolve these attacks while any enemy models remain within their Engagement Range.
    Subtract 1 from hit rolls made when MONSTErs and VEHICLES shoot Heavy weapons while any enemy units remain within their Engagement Range.
    Hit Roll (Ranged Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s BS.
    Hit Roll (Melee Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s WS.
    Critical Hit: Unmodified Hit roll of 6. Always successful.
    An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails.
    WOUND ROLL:
    ATTACK’S STRENGTH VS TARGET’S TOUGHNESS	                    D6 RESULT REQUIRED
    Strength is TWICE (or more than twice) the Toughness.               2+
    Strength is GREATER than the Toughness.	                            3+
    Strength is EQUAL to the Toughness.	                                4+
    Strength is LESS than the Toughness.	                            5+
    Strength is HALF (or less than half) the Toughness.	                6+
    Critical Wound: Unmodified Wound roll of 6. Always successful.
    An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always fails.
    If a model in the target unit has already lost any wounds or had other attacks allocated to it this phase, the attack must be allocated to that model.
    Saving throw: Roll one D6 and modify by the attack’s AP. If result less than the Sv of the selected model, the saving throw is failed and it suffers damage. Otherwise attack is saved.
    Invulnerable Save: Never modified by an attack’s AP.
    Determining Cover Saves: If, when you come to allocate a Wound, the target model’s body (see line of sight) is at least 25% obscured from the point of view of at least one firer, Wounds allocated to that model receive a cover save. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all cover provides a 5+ save. Some types of terrain provide better or worse cover saves; when this is the case the cover save provided will be stated in the rules for the terrain.
    The controlling player can choose to use either a model’s invulnerable save, Cover Save or its Save characteristic.
    Each mortal wound inflicted on a unit causes one model in that unit to lose one wound.
    No saving throws can be made against mortal wounds.
    Mortal wounds inflicted by attacks always apply after any normal damage, even if that damage was saved.
    Inflict damage: The selected model loses a number of wounds equal to the attack’s D.
    If a model is destroyed by an attack, any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost.'),
    ('Charging Phase', 'Select a unit from your army to charge with. Charge with that unit. Declare targets of the charge (must be within 12"). Charge roll = 2D6". If insufficient to move charging unit into Engagement Range of all targets, charge fails. If charge successful, models make their charge move. Cannot make a charge move within Engagement Range of any unit that was not the target of the charge.
    Charging Through Difficult Terrain: Models are slowed when charging through difficult terrain. If, when charging, one or more models have to move through difficult terrain in order to reach the enemy by the shortest possible route, the entire unit subtracts 2 from its total when determining its charge range. If at least one model in the charging unit moved through difficult terrain as part of its charge move, all of the unit’s models must attack at Initiative step 1, regardless of other Initiative modifiers, even if the charging unit is not slowed by difficult terrain. Remember that charging models must engage as many enemies in the target unit as possible.
    Charging Through Dangerous Terrain: In addition to the penalties for charging through difficult terrain, if any model in a charging unit goes through dangerous terrain, that model must immediately take a Dangerous Terrain test. If a model has a rule that states it is not slowed when charging through difficult terrain, it is not slowed by charging through dangerous terrain either, but it must still take a Dangerous Terrain test.
    Charging Units That Have Gone to Ground: If all of the enemy units charged have Gone to Ground, the Initiative penalty for charging through difficult terrain does not apply, and the unit charging through difficult terrain fights at its normal Initiative.
    Failed Charge: If the initial charger is found to be further than its charge range from the enemy, the charge fails and no models are moved.
    FLY models can move over other models when they make a charge move. FLY models move over terrain (including BUILDINGS) like any other model when they make a charge move.
    Overwatch: Before charge roll made, all charge targets that can fire Overwatch can do so. Can never fire Overwatch while enemy units are in Engagement Range. When firing Overwatch, shoot with unit, but attacks only hit on unmodified 6s.
    Select another unit from your army to charge with.
    Once all your units have charged, progress to the Heroic Interventions step.
    Select one CHARACTER unit to perform a Heroic Intervention. Cannot perform a Heroic Intervention if any enemy units are in Engagement Range. Must be an enemy unit within 3" horizontal and 5" vertical to perform a Heroic Intervention. Select another CHARACTER unit to perform a Heroic Intervention.
    Heroic Intervention: Move up to 3". Must end closer to the closest enemy model.
    Once all your CHARACTER units have performed Heroic Interventions, progress to the Fight phase.'),
    ('Fighting Phase', 'In close combat, both players’ models fight. Attacks in close combat work like shots in shooting.
    Initiative Steps: A model’s Initiative determines when he attacks in close combat. Work your way through the Initiative values of the models in the combat, starting with the highest and ending with the lowest. This means that each combat will have ten Initiative steps, starting at Initiative 10 and working down to Initiative 1. You’ll rarely have models fighting at all of the Initiative steps, so just skip any that don’t apply. Models make their attacks when their Initiative step is reached, assuming they haven’t already been killed by a model with a higher Initiative! If both sides have models with the same Initiative, their attacks are made simultaneously. Note that certain situations, abilities and weapons can modify a model’s Initiative.
    Pile-in Move: Up to 3". Every model that moves must end closer to the closest enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit (or no models can Pile In).
    Each engaged model makes a number of attacks (A) as indicated on its characteristics profile, plus the following bonus attacks:
    +1 Charge Bonus: Engaged models that charged this turn get +1 Attack this turn. Models in units that made a disordered charge do not get this bonus.
    +1 Two Weapons: Engaged models with two single-handed weapons (often a Melee weapon and/or pistol in each hand) get +1 Attack. Models with more than two weapons gain no additional benefit; you only get one extra Attack, even if you have four arms and a sword in each.
    Other Bonuses: Models may have other special rules and wargear that confer extra Attacks.
    Consolidation Move: Up to 3". Every model that moves must end closer to the closest enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit if possible. If the above is not possible, each model can move towards the closest objective marker, but this must result in the unit being within range of it and in Unit Coherency. If the above is also not possible, no models can Consolidate.'),
    ('Morale Phase', 'Players alternate taking Morale tests for units from their army that have suffered casualties this turn.
    Morale test = D6 + number of models destroyed this turn. Unmodified roll of 1 always a success (no models flee). If Morale test exceeds unit’s Ld, one model flees and other models must take Combat Attrition tests.
    Combat Attrition tests: Roll one D6 for each remaining model in unit; for each 1, one additional model flees. Subtract 1 from Combat Attrition tests if unit is below Half-strength.
    If one player has no more units left to take Morale tests, their opponent then takes Morale tests for their remaining units, one at a time.
    Once all units have taken Morale tests, progress to the Unit Coherency Checks step.
    Remove models from units in your army that are not in unit coherency.
    Once all out of coherency models have been removed (if any), the Morale phase ends. The player’s turn then ends and, unless the battle ends, the next player’s turn begins.')

In either case, this special rule has no effect against non-vehicle models.'),
    ('Assault', 'If a unit that Run this turn contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s Shooting phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with. A model carrying an Assault weapon can still charge into close combat in the Assault phase.'),
    ('Assault Vehicle', 'Passengers disembarking from Access Points on a vehicle with this special rule can charge on the turn they do so (even in a turn that the vehicle was destroyed, or in the following turn).'),
    ('Barrage', 'All Barrage weapons use blast markers and consequently use the rules for Blast weapons, as indicated by their profile, with the following exceptions:
    Barrage weapons can fire indirectly. This means they can fire at a target that they do not have line of sight to, as long as the target is beyond their minimum range (if applicable). When firing indirectly, the CT of the firer is not subtracted from the scatter distance; unless a Hit! is rolled on the scatter dice, the blast marker always scatters a full 2D6". If a Barrage weapon has line of sight to its target it can fire directly, even if the target is within its minimum range.
    To determine whether a unit wounded by a Barrage weapon is allowed a cover save, and when determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the blast marker, instead of from the firing model. Hits against vehicles are always resolved against their side armour.
    Multiple Barrages: If a unit fires more than one shot with the Barrage special rule, they fire together, as follows:
    The Barrage weapon closest to the target unit fires first. Place the blast marker over the target, then roll for scatter as described earlier.
    Once the first marker is placed, roll a scatter dice for each other Barrage weapon shot fired by the unit. If an arrow is rolled, place the marker in the direction indicated so that it is next to and touching the edge of the first marker placed (see diagram above).
    If a Hit! is rolled, the firing player places the marker so that it touches any part of any marker in the group that has already been placed. Note that it is perfectly fine if some markers are placed overlapping one another (including being directly over the top of a previous marker).
    Once all of the markers are in place, add up the number of hits and roll To Wound for these hits. To determine Wound allocation and cover saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the first blast marker that was placed in the Multiple Barrage.
    Apocalyptic Barrage: An Apocalyptic Barrage follows all of the rules for a Barrage weapon, but uses the clover-shaped apocalyptic barrage marker. Before the marker is placed, the attacker is allowed to rotate the marker about its centre to maximise the number of models that could potentially be hit. Place the marker and roll for scatter in the same way you would for a Blast. If the marker scatters, be careful to maintain the same orientation as you move it.
    Once the final position of the marker has been determined, roll a number of dice equal to the number of attacks on the weapon’s profile. So, for example, with a weapon with the type ‘Heavy 4, Apocalyptic Barrage’, you would roll four dice. Each dice roll corresponds to a ‘strike’ on one of the circles on the apocalyptic barrage marker. For example, each roll of a 2 indicates a strike on circle number 2. Resolve the strikes as for a Multiple Barrage, as if each were a Barrage attack that had landed on that circle and hit all the models underneath it. To determine Wound allocation and cover saves, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the entire apocalyptic barrage marker.'),
    ('Bladestorm', 'When firing a weapon with this special rule, a To Wound roll of 6 wounds automatically, regardless of the target’s Toughness, and is resolved at AP 4'),
    ('Blade Whip', 'Models fighting with a razorflail re-roll all failed To Hit rolls in close combat.'),
    ('Blast', 'When firing a Blast weapon, models do not roll To Hit. Instead, just pick one enemy model visible to the firer and place the 3" blast marker with its hole entirely over the base of the target model (see diagram), or its hull if the target is a vehicle. The hole at the centre of the marker must be within the weapon’s maximum range. You cannot place the blast marker so that the base or hull of any friendly model is even partially under it.
    The large area affected by the blast means it’s going to be very hard to miss completely. Nonetheless, the shot might not land exactly where intended. Roll for the blast marker to scatter and subtract the firer’s CT from the distance (if any) that it scatters, to a minimum of 0". Note that it is possible, and absolutely fine, for a shot to scatter beyond the weapon’s maximum or minimum range and line of sight. This represents the chance of ricochets, the missile blasting through cover and other random events. In these cases, hits are worked out as normal and can hit and wound units out of range and line of sight (or even your own units, or models locked in combat). If the shot scatters so that the hole in the centre of the marker is beyond the table’s edge, the shot is a complete miss and is discarded.
    Once the final position of the blast marker has been determined, take a good look at it from above, each unit suffers one hit for each of their models which is fully or partially beneath the blast marker, even if those models are not within the firer’s line of sight.
    Once the number of hits inflicted on the unit has been worked out, roll To Wound and save as normal. Remember that any Wounds inflicted by weapons with the Blast special rule must be allocated to the closest model in the target unit even if it is out of sight of any models from the attacking unit.
    Multiple Blasts: If a unit is firing more than one shot with the Blast special rule, scatter each shot, one at a time, as described above and determine how many hits are scored with each individual blast marker. After the last shot, add up the total number of hits scored and roll all of the To Wound rolls as normal.
    Blast Weapons and Re-rolls: If a model has the ability to re-roll its rolls To Hit and chooses to do so after firing a Blast weapon, the player must re-roll both the scatter dice and the 2D6.
    Blast Weapons and Snap Shots: Blast weapons cannot be fired as Snap Shots.
    Large Blast: Large Blast weapons use the 5" blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.
    Massive Blast: Massive Blast weapons use the 7" blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.
    Apocalyptic Blast: Apocalyptic Blast: Apocalyptic Blast weapons use the 10 " blast marker, but otherwise obey all the rules for Blast weapons.
    Apocalyptic Mega Blast (5"/7"/10"): Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons use the apocalyptic blast marker. They obey the rules for Blast weapons, with the following exceptions:
    Apocalyptic Mega-blast weapons have three Svalues and three AP values. Correspondingly, the apocalyptic blast marker is divided into three zones, as shown in the diagram to the far right, one for each Sand AP value.
    The Sand AP of any hits depends on the zone where the target model is located. The first Sand AP value are used for the inner zone, the second Sand AP value are used for the middle zone, and the third Sand AP value are used for the outer zone. Always use the best Sand AP if a model straddles two or more zones. If a unit has models in several zones, work out the hits inflicted for each zone separately. Note that there will be a different Wound pool for each zone.'),
    ('Blind', 'Any unit hit by one or more models or weapons with this special rule must take an Initiative test at the end of the current phase. If the test is passed, all is well, a shouted warning has caused the warriors to avert their gaze. If the Initiative test is failed, all models in the unit are reduced to WS and CT 1 until the end of their next turn. Should the attacking unit hit themselves, we assume they are prepared and they automatically pass the test. Any model that does not have an Initiative characteristic (for example, non-Walker vehicles etc.) is unaffected by this special rule.'),
    ('Bombs', 'Bombs are weapon types unique to Flyers and Flyer Monsters. All Bombs have the One Use Only special rule. Unlike other weapons, Bombs must be used in the Movement phase of their turn, in a special kind of attack called a Bombing Run. A model ca n only drop one Bomb in its Movement phase. If a model drops a Bomb, it counts as having already fired one weapon in its ensuing Shooting phase and may not move Flat Out.'),
    ('Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers', 'A unit containing at least one model with this special rule is a Psyker unit, if no Mastery Level is shown, then that unit has a Mastery Level of 1. Rules for generating and manifesting psychic powers can be found in the Psychic phase section. The unit follows all the normal rules for Psykers, with the following clarifications:
    When manifesting a psychic power, this unit measures range and line of sight from, and uses the characteristics profile (if required) of, any one model in the unit that has the Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule (controlling player’s choice).
    If this unit suffers Perils of the Warp, or is hit by an attack that specifically targets Psykers, the hits are Randomly Allocated amongst models with the Brotherhood of Psykers/Sorcerers special rule. If a model with this special rule gains or loses a psychic power, all other models with this special rule in their unit also gain or lose that power.'),

If either the rider or the Chariot is destroyed, the entire model is removed. If the rider has a special rule to return, the Chariot returns with one Hull Point. Chariots move as standard vehicles.
    Shooting with & at Chariots: The rider can shoot his weapons as if stationary, even if the Chariot moved. Hits against a Chariot unit are allocated to the rider or Chariot by the controlling player. Blast hits always target the Chariot. Precision Shots are allocated by the firer. Resolve hits against the Chariot’s Armor Values based on the firing model’s position.
    Assaults: Chariots charge like Bikes, needing to avoid difficult terrain. In close combat, they fight like Infantry. Attacks in close combat are directed at either the rider or the Chariot, not split between them. Grenades can only target the Chariot. Hits against the Chariot use its front Armor. The rider can issue or accept challenges but cannot perform a Glorious Intervention.
    Crew & Beasts: Chariots with crew or beasts cannot be targeted separately. Attacks against a riderless Chariot hit the vehicle. Riderless Chariots count Immobilized results as Crew Stunned. They suffer a glancing hit if they fail a Dangerous Terrain test. They have D6 Hammer of Wrath attacks. The rider has Fearless and Relentless. It can fire Overwatch if charged but not Chariot-mounted weapons.'),

When placing the unit in Reserve, you must tell your opponent that it will be arriving by Deep Strike (sometimes called Deep Strike Reserve). Some units must arrive by Deep Strike. They always begin the game in Reserve and always arrive by Deep Strike.
    Roll for the arrival of all Deep Striking units as specified in the rules for Reserves and then deploy them as follows:
    First, place one model from the unit anywhere on the table, in the position where you would like it to arrive, and roll for scatter to determine the model’s final position. If a vehicle scatters when arriving via Deep Strike, do not change its facing.
    Next, the unit’s remaining models are arranged around the first one. Models must be placed in base contact with the first model and begin to form a circle around it. When the first circle is complete, a further concentric circle must be placed with each model touching the circle inside it. Each circle must include as many models as will fit.
    Models deploying via Deep Strike treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain.
    In the Movement phase during which they arrive, Deep Striking units may not move any further, other than to disembark from a Deep Striking Transport vehicle if they are in one.
    Units Deep Striking into ruins are placed on the ground floor. Deep Striking units count non-ruined buildings (except for their battlements) as impassable terrain.
    In that turn’s Shooting phase, these units can only fire snap shots. Vehicles, except for Walkers, count as having moved at Combat Speed (even Immobilised vehicles). This can affect the number of weapons they can fire with their full CT.
    In that turn’s Assault phase, these units can charge but they can only performed disordered charges.
    Deep Strike and Transports
    Units do not confer the Deep Strike special rule onto a Transport vehicle they are embarked inside. A Transport vehicle with Deep Strike may Deep Strike regardless of whether its passengers have Deep Strike or not.
    Deep Strike Mishaps: If any of the models in a Deep Striking unit cannot be deployed, because at least one model would land partially or fully off the table, in impassable terrain, on top of a friendly model, or on top of or within 1" of an enemy model, something has gone wrong. The controlling player must roll on the Deep Strike Mishap table (below) and apply the results. If the unfortunate unit is also a Transport, the Deep Strike Mishap result applies to both the unit and anything embarked within it.

    Joining and Leaving a Unit: An Independent Character can begin the game already with a unit, either by being deployed in unit coherency with it or, if the unit is in Reserve, by you informing your opponent of which unit it has joined. In order to join a unit, an Independent Character simply has to move so that he is within the 2" unit coherency distance of a friendly unit at the end of their Movement phase. If the Independent Character is within 2" of more than one unit at the end of its Movement phase, the player must declare which unit it is joining. If an Independent Character does not intend to (or cannot) join a unit, it must (where possible) remain more than 2" away from it at the end of the Movement phase. This is to make clear whether they have joined a unit or not. Note that, after an Independent Character joins a unit, that unit can move no further that Movement phase. An Independent Character can leave a unit during the Movement phase by moving out of unit coherency with it. He cannot join or leave during any other phase, once shots are fired or charges are declared, it is too late to join in or duck out! An Independent Character cannot leave a unit while either he or the unit is in Reserves, locked in combat, Falling Back or has Gone to Ground. He cannot join a unit that is in Reserves, locked in combat or Falling Back. If an Independent Character joins a unit, and all other models in that unit are killed, he again becomes a unit of one model at the start of the following phase. While an Independent Character is part of a unit, he counts as part of the unit for all rules purposes, though he still follows the rules for characters.
    Look Out, Sir: Independent Characters pass Look Out, Sir rolls on a 2+.
    Heroic Morale: A unit that contains one or more Independent Characters does not need a double 1 to Regroup if reduced to below 25% of its starting numbers, but instead tests as if it had at least 25% remaining.
    Special Rules: When an Independent Character joins a unit, it might have different special rules from those of the unit. Unless specified in the rule itself (as in the Stubborn special rule), the unit’s special rules are not conferred upon the Independent Character, and the Independent Character’s special rules are not conferred upon the unit. Special rules that are conferred to the unit only apply for as long as the Independent Character is with them.
    Independent Characters and Infiltrate: An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.
    Independent Characters and Ongoing Effects: Sometimes, a unit that an Independent Character has joined will be the target of a beneficial or harmful effect, such as those bestowed by the Blind special rule, for example. If the character leaves the unit, both he and the unit continue to be affected by the effect, so you’ll need to mark the character accordingly. Conversely, if an Independent Character joins a unit after that unit has been the target of an ongoing effect (or joins a unit after himself having been the target of an ongoing effect) benefits and penalties from that effect are not shared.
    Issuing a Challenge: Challenges are issued at the start of the Fight Phase, before any attacks. Only one challenge per combat can be issued, with the side whose turn it is having the first chance. If they decline, the other side can issue a challenge. Once a challenge is made and accepted, no further challenges can be issued until it is resolved. If there are no enemy character’s present, a challenge cannot be issued. Characters unable to fight or not engaged with an enemy cannot issue challenges.
    Accepting a Challenge: If your opponent has issued a challenge, you can now accept it (nominate a character in one of your units locked in the combat to be the challenge).
    Refusing a Challenge: If you refuse the challenge, your opponent selects one of your eligible characters. The chosen model cannot attack this turn, and its Leadership does not benefit the unit for the rest of the phase.
    Heroic Stand: A unit that consists only of a single character cannot refuse a challenge. He’s got nowhere to hide.
    Fighting a Challenge: During a challenge, the two characters move into base contact with each other without risking Difficult or Dangerous Terrain tests. They stay in base contact for the duration of the challenge, always using their opponent’s Toughness for To Hit and To Wound rolls. Wounds caused during the challenge must be allocated to the opponent and cannot be shifted using the Look Out, Sir rule.
    Combatant Slain: In a challenge, any excess Wounds inflicted by the victor are lost if the opponent is slain. Additionally, the challenge remains ongoing until the end of the phase for the purposes of Outside Forces, even if one combatant is slain.
    Outside Forces: In a challenge, other models can only allocate Wounds to the models involved after all other enemy models in the combat have been removed, even if those involved are the closest.
    Assault Result: Unsaved Wounds caused in a challenge count towards the assault result, alongside any unsaved Wounds caused by the rest of the characters’ units.
    Round Two: If both fighters survive and the combat continues, they will keep battling in the next round. However, if a character with And They Shall Know No Fear is caught in a Sweeping Run, the challenge ends. Although new challenges cannot be issued until the ongoing one ends, another character might step in with a Glorious Intervention.
    Glorious Intervention: Characters can perform a Glorious Intervention at the start of their own Fight Phase, if a friendly character in the same combat is entering subsequent rounds of a challenge. They cannot do this in the first round of a challenge or during the enemy turn. Also, characters unable to fight or strike blows cannot perform Glorious Interventions. To succeed, the intervening character must pass an Initiative test. If manifested, they take the place of the friendly character in the challenge. The displaced character fights normally, while the intervening character fights the challenge. They both move into base contact as if accepting the challenge anew.'),

    Units that Infiltrate in this way can be set up anywhere on the table that is more than 12" from any enemy unit, as long as no deployed enemy unit can draw line of sight to them. This includes in a building, as long as the building is more than 12" from any enemy unit. Alternatively, they can be set up anywhere on the table more than 18" from any enemy unit, even in plain sight.
    If a unit with Infiltrate deploys inside a Dedicated Transport, the same rules apply when setting up their Transport.
    A unit that deploys using these rules cannot charge in their first turn.
    Having Infiltrate also confers the Outflank special rule to units of Infiltrators that are kept as Reserves.

    -2-5: Kerr-runch: Each model from the unit being stomped that is even partially under the blast marker suffers a S6 AP4 hit / Kerr-smash: One vehicle in the unit being stomped that is at least partially under the blast marker (stomping model’s choice) suffers a penetrating hit.
    -6: Overrun: Each model from the unit being stomped that is even partially under the blast marker is removed as a casualty / Flipped: One vehicle in the unit being stomped that is at least partially under the blast marker (stomping model’s choice) scatters D6"" and then suffers an Explodes! result.
    Buildings, Flyers, certain Monsters, and Super-heavy vehicles, Walkers, and Flyers are immune to Stomp attacks. No need to roll on the Stomp table for these units if they are under the blast marker.
    Super-heavy Flyers follow the rules for Super-heavy vehicles, including Shooting, Vehicle Damage, Catastrophic Damage, and Transports.
    Super-heavy Flyers do not use Crash and Burn! rules. Instead, they suffer Catastrophic Damage when they lose all their Hull Points, resolved like a Super-heavy vehicle.
    Special Rules: All Super-heavy Flyers have the following special rules: Fear, Invincible Behemoth.'),
    ('Sustained Hit', 'Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, an unmodified 6 To Hit inflicts a number of additional Hit corresponding to the number indicated on its profile.'),
    ('Swarms', 'If, when allocating Wounds to a unit with the Swarms special rule, two or more models could be chosen as the closest enemy, the closest enemy is always the model with the least number of Wounds. If a model with the Swarm special rule suffers an unsaved Wound from a Blast (any size) or Template weapon, each unsaved Wound is multiplied to two unsaved Wounds unless that Wound has the Instant Death special rule. However, a unit entirely composed of models with the Swarm special rule is not slowed by difficult terrain, but must test for Dangerous Terrain as normal.'),
    ('Tanks', 'When moving a vehicle with the Tank type, the player can declare that it is going to attempt to Tank Shock or Ram instead of moving normally.
    Tank Shock: To Tank Shock, pivot the vehicle to face the direction of movement and declare the distance to move, up to its maximum speed. Move straight ahead until contact with an enemy or the declared distance. Tank Shocks cannot target units in combat. If a unit is reached, it must take a Morale check and may Fall Back if it fails. The Tank keeps moving, potentially affecting more units. If it would hit a friendly model, enemy vehicle, impassable terrain, or board edge, it stops 1" away. Models under its path must be moved aside or are removed as casualties.
    Units Already Falling Back: If a unit that is Falling Back is Tank Shocked, the unit automatically fails its Morale check. This also applies if a unit Falls Back from a Tank Shock and the Tank’s remaining move brings it into contact with them a second time.
    Tank Shock from Reserve: A Tank that moves onto the battlefield from Reserve may attempt a Tank Shock. This must be declared before the Tank moves onto the board.
    Tank Shock Restrictions: After a Tank Shock, the vehicle cannot move Flat Out. No embarking or disembarking from a Transport that Tank Shocks that turn, and vice versa. Flyers cannot Tank Shock, even if they are also Tanks.
    Death or Glory: If a unit stands its ground against a Tank Shock, one model can attempt a Death or Glory attack. The attack automatically hits the Tank’s front Armor, and cover saves are not allowed. If manifested, the Tank stops or explodes, but if not, the Tank continues its move, crushing the model attempting the attack. Artillery units can also attempt this with either a crewman or a gun model, risking both if unsuccessful.
    Ramming: Ramming is like a desperate Tank Shock where the Tank moves at full speed towards one enemy vehicle. This prevents shooting anything but Snap Shots that turn, making it suitable for vehicles with no armament or those already Shaken. Ramming follows Tank Shock rules, but when the Ramming Tank hits an enemy vehicle, each vehicle suffers a hit based on its Armor, Mass, and Excessive mass. Both players roll a D6 for determining the Damages inflcted.
    Ramming Restrictions: A vehicle making a Ram maneuver is subject to the same restrictions as a Tank Shock.'),
    ('Tank Hunters', 'A unit that contains at least one model with this special rule re rolls failed To Wound rolls against vehicles (both with shooting and in close combat) and inflicted +D3 Damages with their weapon against Vehicles.'),
    ('Template', 'Template weapons use a template instead of a numerical range. Place the template so it covers as many ennemy models as possible without touching friendly models. Against vehicles, position the template to cover the vehicle without touching friendly models, hitting the facing determined by the firers position. The firer is not hit by their own template weapon.
    Special Rules: Template weapons possess the Ignores Cover, Wall of Death, and No Escape special rules, with wounds allocated as usual. They cannot make Snap Shots.
    Multiple Templates: When a unit fires multiple shots with Template weapons, resolve each shot individually to determine the number of hits. Then, roll To Wound as usual.
    Wall of Death: Template weapons can fire Overwatch, automatically inflicting D3 hits on the charging unit at their normal Sand AP value. There is no need to measure the templates length; it is assumed the ennemy charged into range.
    No Escape: Template weapons hitting an Open topped vehicle with an embarked unit cause D6 hits to that unit, resolved at the weapons Sand AP. Hits are Randomly Allocated.'),
    ('Transport', 'Transports have the (Huge) Transport Capacity X determining the type and maximum number of friendly models they can carry. Units can start the battle embarked within a Transport model, declared before setting it up.
    Unshakable Nerve: Units embarked upon Transports have the Fearless special rule while they are embarked.
    Fire Deck: When this Transport fires, select a weapon from up to X embarked models; the Transport is equipped with those weapons. Models firing from a vehicle moving at Combat Speed count as having moved. Those from a vehicle moving at Cruising Speed can only make Snap Shots. No shooting if the vehicle moves Flat Out or uses smoke launchers, and vice versa.
    Access Points: Each vehicle with passenger capacity has Access Points, like doors or hatches, where passengers enter and exit (including Flying bases).
    Embarking and Disembarking: Units can embark on or disembark from a friendly Transport if all their models end a move within 3" of it. Disembarking units must be wholly within 3" of their Transport and not within Engagement Range of enemies. If a unit disembarks before its Transport moves, it can act normally. If after, it cannot move or charge but can act otherwise.
    Independent Characters & Transports: If an Independent Character and a unit are both in a vehicle, they are automatically joined. Either can join the other by embarking or disembarking together. They can later separate by disembarking individually or together, if they end up more than 2" apart.
    Transports and Assaults: Passengers in a Transport can use Overwatch when the vehicle is assaulted. If the Transport is destroyed, any wounds to passengers do not count for assault results, and survivors are not locked in combat.
    Psychic Powers and Transports: Psykers on a Transport can only use witchfire powers if a Fire Point has line of sight to the target. They cannot use other powers or target units embarked on Transports.
    Effects of Damage on Passengers:
    When a vehicle suffers Crew Shaken, Crew Stunned, Weapon Destroyed, or Immobilized results, embarked units must pass a Leadership test. Failure means they can only make Snap Shots next turn.
    If the vehicle is Wrecked, passengers must disembark within 3"" and take a Pinning test.
    If it Explodes! roll a D6 for each disembarking model; on a 1, they suffer 1 mortal wound. Survivors are placed nearby and take a Pinning test.
    For Zooming Flyers, the rules are the same except a roll of 1-3 causes a mortal wound.
    If a Transport is destroyed by shooting, shooters can charge its disembarked passengers.'),
    ('Twin-linked', 'Twin-linked weapons re-rolls all failed To Hit rolls.
    Twin-linked Blast Weapons: If the scatter dice does not roll a hit, you can choose to re-roll the dice with a Twin-linked Blast weapon. If you choose to do so, you must re-roll both the 2D6 and the scatter dice.
    Twin-linked Template Weapons: Twin-linked Template weapons are fired just like a single weapon, but must re-roll failed To Wound rolls and armour penetration rolls.'),
    ('Two Handed', 'A model attacking with this weapon never receives +1A for fighting with two Melee weapons.'),
    ('Unwieldy', 'A model attacking with this weapon Piles In and fights at Initiative step 1, unless it is a Monster or a Walker.'),
    ('Vector Dancer', 'A model with this special rule can make an additional pivot on the spot of up to 90° at the end of its move. A model that uses this extra pivot cannot move Flat Out in the following Shooting phase.'),
    ('Vector Strike', 'When Swooping or Zooming, this model may savage its prey. At the end of the Movement phase, nominate one enemy unit not locked in combat that the model has moved over that turn. That unit takes 1 hit (if the unit is an enemy Flyer in Zoom mode it instead takes D3 hits). Unless stated otherwise, Vector Strike hits are resolved at the model’s unmodified Strength and AP2, using Random Allocation. These hits have the Ignores Cover special rule. These hits do not benefit from any of the model’s special rules, such as Furious Charge, Poisoned, Rending etc. Against vehicles, these hits are resolved against the target’s side armour.
    A model that made a Vector Strike in its Movement phase counts as having already fired one weapon in its following Shooting phase. However, any additional weapons it fires that turn can choose a different target to that of the Vector Strike.'),
    ('Vortex', 'A weapon with this special rule is a Destroyer weapon and uses a blast marker of some type (e.g. blast, large blast, massive blast, etc). Place the appropriate marker, roll for scatter and apply damage. For determining Wound allocation, always assume the shot is coming from the centre of the marker, in the same manner as a Barrage weapon.
    The marker for a Vortex weapon is not removed from play after damage has been resolved. Leave it in play on the tabletop. The marker is impassable terrain as long as it remains in play.
    At the beginning of every subsequent player turn, the marker scatters 2D6" (use the little arrow if you roll a Hit!). If a double is rolled, the marker is removed from play instead. Any unit under the marker’s new location is hit. Apply damage as described above.'),
    ('Walker', 'Measure ranges and distances to/from a Walker’s base or hull. Weapons of a Walker are measured differently.
    Moving Walkers: Walkers move like Infantry, handling difficult terrain similarly. They are Immobilized if they fail a Dangerous Terrain test. Walkers have facings, affecting their firing arcs and Armor Value when attacked. They can Run, foregoing shooting and charging, except when Stunned or Immobilized.
    Firing Walkers: Walker weapons can swivel up to 45° horizontally and vertically. Measure ranges from the weapon and line of sight from its mounting point. They can fire Overwatch and at units outside their weapon arc unless immobilized. Determine Armor Value based on the body’s position relative to the firing model.
    Fighting Walkers: Walker’s assault and are assaulted like Infantry models in close combat. They fight like Infantry but may gain additional Attacks for each Melee weapon they wield. Shaken damage does not affect their close combat abilities. Immobilized or Stunned Walkers have reduced Attacks. They can make Sweeping Runs, Pile In moves, and Consolidations unless Stunned or Immobilized. When rammed by a Tank, resolve the collision as with vehicles. All Walkers have the Hammer of Wrath special rule.'),
    ('Warp Mutation', 'If the bearer slays an enemy Character or Monster, roll a D6: on the roll of a 2+ the victim is transformed into a Chaos Spawn under the control of the Daemon player. Place a new Chaos Spawn model (under your control), anywhere within 6" of the victim that is more than 1" from any unit (friend or foe) and impassable terrain. Once you have placed the Chaos Spawn remove the victim as a casualty.'),
    ('Wrath of Angels', 'For every successful Wound roll of a 6 made with this weapon, that unit suffers an additional wound using the same weapon profile.'),
    ('Zealot', 'A unit containing one or more models with the Zealot special rule automatically passes Pinning, Fear and Regroup tests and Morale checks, but cannot Go to Ground and cannot choose to fail a Morale check due to the Our Weapons Are Useless rule. If a unit gains the Zealot special rule when it has Gone to Ground, all the effects of Go to Ground are immediately cancelled.
    In addition, units containing one or more models with the Zealot special rule re-roll all failed To Hit rolls at close combat.')

VALUES
    ('Infantry', 'Infantries are the most common and dependable units in Warhammer 40,000. As the bulk of the rules are concerned with them, there are no additional rules to present here.'),
    ('Bike', 'Bikes have several special rules: they cannot Go to Ground or be Pinned, treat difficult terrain as dangerous, move 3D6" when Falling Back, and have the Hammer of Wrath, Jink, Relentless, and Very Bulky abilities. They cannot Run but can Turbo-boost instead, adding 12" to their Movement characteristic, but cannot shoot, charge, or take other actions until their next turn after Turbo-boosting.'),
    ('Jetbike', 'Jetbikes have special rules: they cannot Go to Ground or be Pinned, are not slowed by difficult terrain, can move over other models and terrain, but must test for Dangerous Terrain if they start or end their move in it. They move 3D6" when Falling Back and have Hammer of Wrath, Jink, Relentless, and Very Bulky abilities. They cannot Run but can Turbo-boost instead, adding 24" to their Movement characteristic, but cannot shoot, charge, or take other actions until their next turn after Turbo-boosting.'),
    ('Artillery', 'If all crew models are killed, the guns are removed. Additional models added to the crew can operate the guns. Independent Characters cannot operate the guns. Artillery units need at least one crewman per gun to move. Crewmen within 2" of a gun in the Shooting phase can fire it, while others can fire side arms. Guns require line of sight to the target from both the gun model and firing crewman. Wounds are allocated to the crew first. Artillery units cannot charge. In combat, only engaged crew models can fight back. Abandoned guns without crewmen are removed when the unit Falls Back. If forced to Fall Back from close combat, the unit is automatically destroyed if the enemy can make a Sweeping Run.'),
    ('Jump', 'Jump units can use their jump packs once per turn in either the Movement or Assault phase. They cannot use them in both phases in the same turn. If not using jump packs, they move normally. The entire unit must use the same form of movement. Jump units move up to 2 times their Movement characteristic when using jump packs in the Movement phase and can reroll charge distance and gain the Hammer of Wrath rule when using jump packs to charge. Their Fall-Back moves are always 3D6". They also have the Bulky and Deep Strike special rules.'),
    ('Jet Pack', 'Jet Pack units have the option to move as normal or use their jet packs. When using jet packs, they can move over models and terrain freely but must test for Dangerous Terrain if starting or ending in difficult terrain. They cannot end their move on other models unless its impassable terrain treated as dangerous. In the Assault phase, they can move up to 2D6" if not charging, even after shooting or running. They also have the Bulky, Deep Strike, and Relentless special rules.'),
    ('Beast', 'Beasts are not slowed by difficult terrain (even when charging) and automatically pass Dangerous Terrain tests. Beasts make Fall Back moves just like Infantry, except that they move 3D6". Beasts have the Fleet special rule.'),
    ('Cavalry', 'Cavalries are not slowed down by difficult terrain (even when charging). However, Cavalry models treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain instead. Cavalries are not slowed down by difficult terrain (even when charging). However, Cavalry models treat all difficult terrain as dangerous terrain instead. Cavalries have the Fleet and Hammer of Wrath special rules.'),
    ('Monster', 'Monsters may never Go to Ground, voluntarily or otherwise. Monsters have the Fear, Hammer of Wrath, Move Through Cover, Relentless and Smash special rules.'),
    ('Vehicle', 'Measuring Distances: As vehicle models do not usually have bases, the normal rule of measuring distances to or from a base cannot be used. Instead, for distances involving a vehicle, measure to and from their hull, ignore gun barrels, dozer blades, antennas, banners and other decorative elements. There is, however, the notable exception of a vehicle’s weaponry. When firing a vehicle’s weapons, ranges are measured from the muzzle of the firing weapon, whilst line of sight is determined from the weapon’s mounting point and along its barrel.
    Movement Phase: Vehicles pivot around their center-point to turn, without moving. This maneuver does not count as movement, making the vehicle Stationary if it only pivots. Immobilized vehicles cannot pivot. They cannot move over friendly models, like other units.
    - Stationary: A vehicle that remains Stationary will be able to bring its full firepower to bear on the enemy.
    - Combat Speed: A vehicle that travels up to Movement Characteristics is said to be moving at Combat Speed.
    - Cruising Speed: A vehicle that travels up to 1,5 times its Movement Characteristics (round in superior) is said to be moving at Cruising Speed.
    Difficult and Dangerous Terrain: Vehicles ignore slowdowns in broken terrain but treat it as dangerous. Failing a Dangerous Terrain test costs them a Hull Point and causes an Immobilized result.
    Psychic Phase: Even vehicles can harbor powerful connections to the Warp. Vehicles with the Psychic Pilot special rule manifest their psychic powers during the Psychic phase, as normal.
    Shooting Phase: Vehicles with Relentless rule can fire weapons based on their movement:
    - Stationary: All Heavy weapons.
    - Combat Speed: All weapons at full accuracy, except Heavy weapon which Snap Shots.
    - Cruising Speed: Only Snap Shots allowed.
    Ordnance Weapons: Vehicles can move and fire Ordnance weapons, but when they do, their other weapons can only make Snap Shots that turn. Even at Cruising Speed, vehicles can Snap Shoot Ordnance, but cannot fire other Ordnance weapons unless it is a Snapshot.
    Line of Sight: When firing a vehicle’s weapons, check line of sight from each weapon’s mounting and along its barrel. If the target unit is in partial cover from some of the vehicle’s weapons, calculate cover saves for each firing weapon separately. Ensure the target is within the weapon’s arc of sight, even for Barrage weapons.
    Moving Flat Out: A vehicle can opt to move Flat Out instead of shooting, moving up to its Movement characteristic plus 6". This movement triggers Dangerous Terrain tests. However, a Tank cannot move Flat Out if it performed a Tank Shock in the same turn.
    Shooting at Vehicles: When targeting a vehicle, a unit must have line of sight to its hull or turret. Roll To Hit and, If manifested, roll to penetrate the vehicle’s Armor Value. Shots are resolved against the facing from which they come; determine this by drawing two lines through the vehicle’s corners.
    Blast Weapons: When using a Blast weapon against a vehicle, place the marker over any part of the vehicle’s hull and roll for scatter. Each blast hitting the vehicle targets the Armor Value facing the firer, regardless of the marker’s position.
    Template Weapons: If a vehicle, or its base, is even partially under a template, it is hit on the Armor Value facing the firer.
    Resolving a Damage: After deducting Hull Points, roll a D6 for each penetrating hit and consult the Vehicle Damage table, applying modifiers from high AP weapons. All modifiers are cumulative.
    Glancing Hits: If a glancing hit was scored, the vehicle loses 1 Hull Point.
    Penetrating Hits: If a penetrating hit was scored, the vehicle not only loses 1 Hull Point, but also suffers additional damage.
    High AP Weapons: AP-4 weapons add +1 to the Vehicle Damage table roll for penetrating hits, while AP-5 weapons add +2.
    Vehicle Damage Results and Hull Points: If a rule inflicts Crew Shaken, Crew Stunned, Weapon Destroyed, or Immobilized on a vehicle without mentioning losing a Hull Point or taking damage, apply the corresponding result from the Vehicle Damage chart without losing any Hull Points.
    Wrecked Vehicles: A vehicle reduced to 0 Hull Points becomes a Wreck. If it was a Flyer in Zoom mode, it undergoes a Crash and Burn! as per the Vehicle Damage table. Otherwise, it remains in place as difficult terrain, like Citadel scenery.
    Damage Table:
    - 1-3: Crew Shaken. The vehicle can only fire Snap Shots until the end of its next turn.
    - 4: Crew Stunned. The vehicle can only fire Snap Shots until the end of its next turn. If the vehicle is a Zooming Flyer, it must move 20" and cannot turn at all in its next Movement phase. If the vehicle is not a Zooming Flyer, it cannot move or pivot until the end of its next turn.
    - 5: Weapon Destroyed. One of the vehicle’s weapons (randomly chosen) is destroyed (including any combi-, built in, out of ammunition weapons or upgrades that are weapons. If a vehicle has no weapons left, treat this result as an Immobilized result instead.
    - 6: Immobilized. If the vehicle is a Chariot, count this result as a Crew Stunned result instead. If the vehicle is a Zooming Flyer, roll a further D6: on a 1 or 2, that Flyer will immediately Crash and Burn! on a 3+ the Flyer counts this result as Crew Stunned instead. Other vehicles are Immobilized. An Immobilized vehicle cannot move. It may not even pivot, but its turrets may continue to rotate to select targets, and other weapons retain their normal arcs of fire. Any Immobilized results suffered by an already Immobilized vehicle instead remove an additional Hull Point.
    - 7+: Explodes! The vehicle is destroyed. If the vehicle is a Zooming Flyer, it will immediately Crash and Burn! otherwise nearby units are impacted by the deadly demise special rule listed in the Vehicle profile. The vehicle is then removed from the battlefield.
    Crash and Burn! Centre the large blast marker over the Flyer, it then scatters 2D6". Any units under the blast marker’s final position are impacted by the deadly demise special rule listed in the Vehicle profile. The Flyer is then removed from the battlefield.
    Cover/Obscured Targets: 
    - For a vehicle to be in cover, at least 25% of its facing must be obscured from the firer’s perspective.
    - Being inside terrain does not automatically provide cover; the 25% rule applies.
    - Vehicles cannot Go to Ground.
    - Obscured vehicles take cover saves against hits that cause damage, like non-vehicle models.
    - If a unit cannot see one facing but can see another, it can still shoot, with the target gaining a slightly better cover save.
    Assault Phase:
    Assaulting with a Vehicle: Vehicles cannot charge. Note that Walkers and Chariots are exceptions to this.
    Assaulting a Vehicle: Infantry can pose a grave threat to vehicles if they get close enough. They can wreck a vehicle by shooting through vision slits, planting explosives on fuel tanks, tearing open hatches to attack the crew or committing some other equally imaginative act of mayhem.
    Charging a Vehicle: A unit can charge a vehicle in their Charge Phase. The charge move is conducted the same as for charging other enemy units.
    Vehicles and Overwatch: Unless specified otherwise, vehicles cannot make Overwatch fire.
    Fighting the Assault: Vehicle fight using their Melee Weapons.
    In close combat, all hits are resolved against the vehicle’s rear Armor, to represent the chance of attacking a vulnerable spot.
    Assault Results: In combat against vehicles, there is no Pile In or locking in combat. Calculate assault results normally, with glancing hits as 1 Wound and penetrating hits as 2 Wounds. If the vehicle loses, nothing changes. If it wins, the enemy may have to Fall Back on a failed Morale check, but there is no Consolidation or Sweeping Run. nothing happens. 
    Successive Turns: If a vehicle stays stationary after surviving an assault, enemy models in base contact are not locked in combat and can be shot during the Shooting phase. If the vehicle pivots, move these models aside and then back into contact afterward. During the Assault phase, units with models in contact can attack the vehicle again.
    Vehicles, Leadership and Morale: Vehicles are considered steadfast, never taking Morale checks or Leadership tests. Any occasional setbacks are represented by Crew Shaken and Crew Stunned results on the Vehicle Damage table.')
